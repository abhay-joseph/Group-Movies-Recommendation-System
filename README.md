# Movies_Recommendation_System

# Project Description

This repository uses the dataset from Movie-lens to form groups based on two distinct criteria and scenarios, resulting in two different group sizes, 3 and 10. Scenario 1 addresses the recommendation for a group of users (3) with commonly watched movies. Scenario 2 tackles the cold-start problem in group recommendation for a larger group of users (10).

# How to run

First, you need to add the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/). Then you need to add the scrapped data from the Data folder that was generated by running the [Scrapping file](Scrapping_Final.ipynb).

Now for each scenario, you need to run the clustering notebook, then the respective model desired.
